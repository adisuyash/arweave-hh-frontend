# Convergent
Convergent is a cutting-edge project that aims to create synthetic assets that mimic the price of another asset without ever holding the actual asset. <br>
This innovation allows users to gain exposure to various assets without the need to physically own them, providing a seamless and efficient way to diversify and manage investments.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

### Frontend
The frontend source code is located in the Synthetix folder in our GitHub repository. This section handles the user interface and interactions, providing a smooth and intuitive experience for users.

#### Folder Structure
```
/Synthetix
  ├── public
  ├── src
  ├── package.json
  ├── README.md
  └── ... (other necessary files and folders)
```
### Backend
The backend code, which handles Convergent's core logic and data processing, is hosted on the BetterIDEA.
